# WEEK 1 BIG O NOTATION 

The Students are to write these simple Algorithms and perform a Big O Notation Analysis on it, to check the performance of their algorithm. 

Poker Chips: Luigy works in a Casino and he gives customers poker chips in exchange of money. Find the minimum number of chips Luigy can use to match the customer requests. He has chips worth 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 1. For example, for 126 Luigy should give 3 chips (100, 25, 1). 

Duplicate characters: Find the top most repeated character in a string. For instance, given a string ‘hello world’, the top most repeated character is ‘l’ because it can be found 3 times in the string. 

You have a list of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index. For example a list [1, 3,7,4] returns [84, 28, 12, 21] which is by calculating [7*3*4, 1*7*4, 1*3*4, 1*7*3]
